> Download this files in a single folder:
  - merge.py
  - clean.py
  - rat_present_checker.py
  - ratVSbat_analysis.py
  - Assignment 2 Merged Dataset analysis .py
  - and lastly dataset 1 & dataset2
    
> run them chronologically:

  - merge.py ( Merges dataset1 & dataset2 and provides a new merged dataset)
  - clean.py ( For cleaning the merged dataset and gives a clean dataset)
  - rat_present_checker.py ( creates a new dataset with rat presence)
    
> Now you can run the following files in any order:
  - Assignment 2 Merged Dataset analysis .py
  - ratVSbat_analysis.py
